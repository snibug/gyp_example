// loosely modeled after test_shell_platform_delegate.h
// LBShellPlatformDelegate isolates a variety of platform-specific
// functions so that code can invoke them by purpose without resorting to
// ifdefs or runtime platform checks.  Each platform should define an
// implementation of this class.  In many cases, implementation of methods
// in this class will be stubs on platforms where those functions are
// unnecessary.
